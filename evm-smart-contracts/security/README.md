# Security

There are a lot of layers we need to address about the security of our smart contract suite. To make sure our users and our customers have a secure and fast experience when spending their assets through Bando.\
\
As a best practice, we keep documenting the possible ways our smart contracts could be attacked. This is useful for security experts, pen testers, auditors, and our own researchers.

We also maintain and update a Rekt Test to continuosly have a simple assessment of our security practices:
