# The On-chain Spending Protocol

It's been hard to spend your tokens.

Our protocol enables a seamless way for Web3 users to access real-world value through prepaid codes, airtime top-ups, bill payments, in-game items, digital goods, and other fulfillable products or services. We achieve this through smart contracts that securely register and route user spend requests to verified fulfillers.
