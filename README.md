# The Web3 Spending Protocol

It's been hard to spend your tokens.&#x20;

Our protocol is about enabling an easy and seamless way for  web3 users to spend via gift cards, airtime top-ups, bill payments, in-game items, digital goods, and any other fulfillable product or service. We do this with a set of smart contracts that register and route user spend requests to the corresponding fulfiller to make the request whole.
