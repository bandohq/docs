# The Web3 Spending Protocol

It's been hard to spend your tokens.&#x20;


Our protocol enables a seamless way for Web3 users to access real-world value through gift cards, airtime top-ups, bill payments, in-game items, digital goods, and other fulfillable products or services. We achieve this through smart contracts that securely register and route user spend requests to verified fulfillers.
