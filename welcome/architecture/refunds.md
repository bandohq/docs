# Refunds

## Automatic Refunds

Sometimes a specific product or brand will be unavailable or something will naturally go wrong. Our protocol handles these failures and submits a refund back to the paying wallet on every scenario after we have verified that a transaction is valid.

## Handling Disputes

If a transaction is marked as invalid then no refund will be made automatically for security purposes (an invalid transaction means our strict system marked one or more checks as failed). Disputes can be handled with our support team to support@bando.cool or v√≠a our support chat.
