# Enabling spending in web3

Our protocol is about enabling spending for the web3 ecosystem via gift cards, airtime top-ups, bill payments, in-game items, digital goods, and any other fulfillable product or service. It does this with a set of smart contracts that register and route user spend requests to the corresponding fulfiller to make the request whole.
